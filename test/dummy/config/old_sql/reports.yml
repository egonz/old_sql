# Old SQL Reports YAML
# This is an example report. Replace it with your actual reports.
#
# 'description' is the value displayed in the 'SELECT A REPORT' drop down list.
#
# The 'report_sql' file should be located under config/old_sql/report_sql.
# See config/old_sql/report_sql/user_old_sql_demo.sql for an example.
#
# The 'report_processor' parameter is optional, and should point to a class in lib/old_sql.
# See lib/old_sql/user_old_sql_demo_processor.rb for an example.
# 
# 'report_processor' names should be capitalized and separated with underscores. The file
# itself should follow normal ruby class naming conventions.
#
# 'report_design' is also optional, and should point to a file in config/old_sql/report_design.
# See config/old_sql/report_design/user_old_sql_demo.csv for an example.
#
# 'report_view' is optional. It overrides the default_report_view defined in the initializer. It
# can be set to jqgrid, table, or chart.
#
# 'query_vars' are variables that are passed into the SQL file and can be parsed using ERB.
#
# Optionally use 'report_db' to specify a class that extends ActiveRecord::Base. Use the require
# path for your class. E.g. foo/my_alternative_db. 
#
# The 'fields' are the headers for the report.
