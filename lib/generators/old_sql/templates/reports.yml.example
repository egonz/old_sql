# Old SQL Reports YAML
# This is an example report. Replace it with your actual reports.
#
# The 'report_sql' file should be located under config/old_sql/report_sql.
# See config/old_sql/report_sql/user_old_sql_demo.sql for an example.
#
# The 'fields' are the headers for the report.
#
# The 'processor' parameter is optional, and should point to a class in lib/old_sql.
# See lib/old_sql/user_old_sql_demo_processor.rb for an example.
# 
# 'report_processor' names should be capitalized and separated with underscores. The file
# itself should follow normal ruby class naming conventions.
#
# 'report_design' is also optional, and should point to a file in config/old_sql/report_design.
# See config/old_sql/report_design/user_old_sql_demo.csv for an example.
