# TODO

* Allow multiple sql files
* Move javascript in index.html.erb into a separate javascript file.
* As an alternative to report_processors allow for a csv file that defines the format of the report.
  Use symbols in the cells for the columns. Math operators could be used for performing calculations.
  If this works we could write a complex report with zero ruby/rails code, html, or javascript.   
* Try and implement jqgrid sort and search methods.
  This should be done in the sql files by passing the params from jqgrid into them.
* Add Devise support
